  - The output of `zospy.analyses.polarization.TestPolarizationPupilMap` differs from the reference OpticStudio version in the returned Orientation. 
    This is a difference between the two OpticStudio versions, not an issue with ZOSPy. 
    As a result, the following unit tests fail:
     - `test_polarization_pupil_map_matches_reference_data[1-1-45-90-Image-17x17]`
