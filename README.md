# ZOSPy

## About

Wrapper around the [Ansys Zemax OpticStudio](https://www.zemax.com/pages/opticstudio) API that provides a more pythonic and
intuitive way to interact with the [ZOS-API](https://www.zemax.com/blogs/free-tutorials/getting-started-with-zos-api)
through python using a .NET connection. It thereby allows you to do more
optics modelling with less coding.

In addition to full access to all the OpticStudio fucntions through the ZOS-API, ZOSPy provides the following features:

- Wrapper functions for several OpticStudio analyses in `zospy.analyses`;
- Easy access to solvers in `zospy.solvers`;
- Easy access to all API constants in `zospy.constants`;
- Autocomplete for all ZOS-API endpoints and constants.

## Dependencies

ZOSPy officially supports Python 3.9 - 3.11. It may work with older Python versions, but support is not provided for
these versions.

### Python packages

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

### Software

- [Ansys Zemax OpticStudio](https://www.zemax.com/pages/opticstudio)

### Compatibility

> :warning: Version 1.0.0 introduced some breaking changes. See
> the [release notes](https://github.com/MREYE-LUMC/ZOSPy/releases/tag/v1.0.0) for more information.

ZOSPy is tested with the following versions of Python and Ansys Zemax OpticStudio:

| Zemax       | 20.3.2 | 23.0.1 |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Python 3.9  | ⚠      | ✔      |
| Python 3.10 | ⚠      | ✔      |
| Python 3.11 | ⚠      | ✔      |

✔: This version works without problems.
⚠: This version works, but the output of analyses can differ slightly from the used reference version (currently **OpticStudio 23 R1.01**).

## Basic usage

### Initiating connection

The connection as extension to running software OpticStudio is initiated as:

```python
import zospy as zp

zos = zp.ZOS()
zos.wakeup()
zos.connect_as_extension()
oss = zos.get_primary_system()
```

Make sure that the OpticStudio software is set up to be connected to as extension through the API. Alternatively, a
standalone OpticStudio application can be launched by changing the last two lines to:

```python
zos.create_new_application()
oss = zos.get_primary_system()
```

### Using solvers

Solvers for the Lens Data Editor are available through `zp.solvers`. Every solver requires a surface as its first
parameter.

#### Examples

```python
import zospy.solvers as solvers

surface = oss.LDE.GetSurfaceAt(2)
solvers.position(surface.ThicknessCell, from_surface=1, length=10)
```

### Performing analyses

Implemented analyses are available though `zp.analyses`. The available analyses are grouped in files that correspond to
the analysis groups in OpticStudio (e.g. `zp.analyses.mtf`and `zp.analyses.wavefront`). Every analysis requires the
OpticStudioSystem `oss` as first parameter.

#### Examples

```python
from zp.analyses.mtf import fft_through_focus_mtf

mtf = fft_through_focus_mtf(oss, sampling='64x64', deltafocus=0.1, oncomplete='Close')
```

```python
from zp.analyses.reports import cardinal_points

cp = cardinal_points(oss, surf1=3, surf2=4, oncomplete='Release')
```

A full description of the available function parameters is provided in the docstrings.

### Constants

After initiating the connection, all api constants are available through `zp.constants` (
e.g. `zp.constants.Editors.LDE.SurfaceType`). Note that these are only available after `zos.wakeup()` has been called,
as explained under **Initiating connection**.

### Convenience functions

Some convenience functions are available through `zp.functions`, e.g. to change a surface to a standard stuface:

```python
newsurf = oss.LDE.InsertNewSurfaceAt(0)
zp.functions.lde.surface_change_type(newsurf, 'Standard')
```

### Full example

This example creates a simple optical system consisting of a single lens.

```python
# Create a new, empty system
oss.new()

# Set aperture and wavelength
oss.SystemData.Aperture.ApertureType = zp.constants.SystemData.ZemaxApertureType.FloatByStopSize
oss.SystemData.Wavelengths.GetWavelength(1).Wavelength = 0.543  # in μm

# Set the object at infinity
surface_object = oss.LDE.GetSurfaceAt(0)
surface_object.Thickness = float("inf")

# Use a very small stop size, so the system is approximately paraxial
surface_stop = oss.LDE.GetSurfaceAt(1)
surface_stop.SemiDiameter = 0.1

# Add a lens with n = 1.5
lens_front = oss.LDE.InsertNewSurfaceAt(2)
lens_front.Comment = "lens front"
lens_front.Radius = 20
lens_front.Thickness = 1
zp.solvers.material_model(lens_front.MaterialCell, refractive_index=1.5)

lens_back = oss.LDE.InsertNewSurfaceAt(3)
lens_back.Comment = "lens back"
lens_back.Radius = -20
lens_back.Thickness = 19.792  # System is in focus
```

### Logging

Some basic logging is implemented through the
standard [python logging module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) (but still under development). The
following implementation examples assume that `import logging` has been executed.

1. To enable logging output from all ZOSPy and other modules using logging.basicConfig:
    ```python
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    ```
2. To enable logging output from all ZOSPy and other modules using a root logger:
    ```python
    fmt = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    sh = logging.StreamHandler()
    sh.setFormatter(fmt)
    sh.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

    logger = logging.getLogger()
    logger.addHandler(sh)
    ```
3. To enable logging output from only ZOSPy
    ```python
    logging.getLogger('zospy').addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())
    logging.getLogger('zospy').setLevel(logging.INFO)
    ```
