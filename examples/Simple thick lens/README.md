# Example: Simple thick lens

This example shows how to create and analyze a simple thick lens as described in the paper [ZOSPy: optical ray tracing in Python through OpticStudio](../../paper). The code resembles the example of the paper with the addition of plotting the analysis results.

## Included functionalities
* _Sequential mode_:
  - Building a simple sequential optical system.
  - Usage of `zospy.analyses.mtf.fft_through_focus_mtf` to calculate the FFT through focus MTF.
  - Usage of `zospy.analyses.psf.huygens_psf()` to perform a Huygens PSF analysis.
