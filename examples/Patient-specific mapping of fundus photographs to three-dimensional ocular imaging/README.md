# Patient-specific mapping of fundus photographs to three-dimensional ocular imaging

This example contains raytracing simulations and analyses for the paper [*Patient-specific mapping of fundus photographs to three-dimensional ocular imaging*](https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.17576).
This example consists of two parts: the first part demonstrates the raytracing simulations, and the second part performs some analyses on these results.
This is the original code, which has been published together with the paper.
This version has been tested to work with ZOSPy 1.1.1 and OpticStudio 23 R2.
