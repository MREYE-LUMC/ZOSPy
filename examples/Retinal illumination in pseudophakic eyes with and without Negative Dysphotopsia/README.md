# Example: Retinal illumination in pseudophakic eyes with and without Negative Dysphotopsia

This example shows how to determine the peripheral retinal illumination in models of the (pseudophakic) human eye using ZOSPy. The analysis presented in the [Analyze.py](Analyze.py) script is a basic example of the analyses perfomed for the scientific paper [Effect of anatomical differences and intraocular lens design on Negative Dysphotopsia](https://doi.org/10.1097/j.jcrs.0000000000001054). The required eye models and STL files have kindly been provided by the authors.

## Included functionalities

* _Non-sequential mode_:
  - Performing non-sequential ray traces.
  - Reading out detector data from a `CAD Part:STL` surface.
