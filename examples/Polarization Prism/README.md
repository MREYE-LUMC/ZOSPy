# Example: Polarization Prism

This example shows how to perform and subsequently plot a polarization analysis in a prisim with total internal reflection. [The provided iPython Notebook](polarization_prism_example.ipynb) is dependent on the example file _"[Prism using total internal reflection.zmx](Prism%20using%20total%20internal%20reflection.zmx)"_, which is also supplied. 

## Included functionalities

* _Sequential mode_:
  - Usage of `zospy.analyses.polarization.transmission()` to perform a polarization transmission analysis.
  - Usage of `zospy.analyses.polarization.polarization_pupil_map` to calculate the polarization pupil map.
