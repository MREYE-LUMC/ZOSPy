# Example: Escudero-Sanz eye model

This example shows how to create and analyze a wide-angle eye model described in the paper _[Off-axis aberrations of a wide-angle schematic eye model](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.16.001881)_  by I. Escudero-Sanz and R. navarro.

## Included functionalities
* _Sequential mode_:
  - Usage of `zospy.solvers.material_model()` to model the refractive index of the elements of the eye.
  - Usage of `zospy.analyses.viewers.viewer_3d` and `zospy.analyses.viewers.shaded_model()` to open viewers.
  - Usage of `zospy.analyses.psf.huygens_psf()` to perform a Huygens PSF analysis.
