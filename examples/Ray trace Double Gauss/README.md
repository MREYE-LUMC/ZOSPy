# Example: Ray trace Double Gauss

This example shows how to determine, perform and subsequently plot single ray traces and ray fan analyses in a Double Gauss lens. [The provided code](Ray%20trace%20double%20gauss.py) is dependent on the example file _"Double Gauss 28 degree field.zmx"_ as provided by OpticStudio. 

## Included functionalities
* _Sequential mode_:
  - Usage of `zospy.analyses.raysandspots.single_ray_trace()` to perform a single ray trace.
  - Usage of `zospy.analyses.raysandspots.ray_fan()` to perfrom a ray fan analysis.
